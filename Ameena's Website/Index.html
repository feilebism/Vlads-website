			<p>Dear Vlad,</p>
		
			<p>I have a lot to tell you, but my problem is that I simply have no words. I have no words for the butterflies that you give me. I have no words to describe the way I feel about you. I have no words for what I think, every second of the day. I have no words to explain anything... How am I meant to write a letter with no words to explain myself, Vladimir?</p>
		
			<p>I want to tell you everything, I really do. It's just that I don't exactly know how to. How do I explain this weird fuzziness at the pit of my stomach that only occurs whenever I talk to you? How do I explain the way my heart races with joy every time I hear your voice? How do I explain the way I want to stay up all night just to talk to you? How do I explain how much I want you? How do I explain how I want you to want me back? How do I explain how I want to be by your side through everything; the thick and the thin? How do I explain how I want to be that one girl that is constantly on your mind? Tell me how to explain all of this because I really have no clue.</p>
		
			<p><b>But there is one thing I do know.</b></p>
		
			<p>I want you, Vlad. I know I just said it but I'll say it again because of how true it is. I want you. I want all of you. Every single fibre. Every inch. Your body, heart and soul. I want you in the flesh. I want all of your flaws and all of your imperfections. I want everything that is you. I want you. I crave you.</p>
		
			<p>I want to be your soulmate. I want to be the one you go to when you have your off days. I want to be able to make you smile just as you make me. I want to make memories with you. I want to grow old and reminisce; not alone, but with you. I want to snuggle with you and steal your shirts. I want to rest my head on your chest and listen to your heartbeat. I want to fall asleep in your arms and take all of your warmth. I want us to play video games with each other. I want you to teach me everything you know. I want for us to go on long walks and do dumb things like climb trees and have snowball fights. I want to sneak out and look at the stars with you. I want to dance with you. I want you to tell me all of your corny jokes because they're secretly funny despite the amount of cringe. I want us to giggle at the dumbest things until it turns into that spastic laughter, where we can't breathe and look like retarded seals. I want to watch your fav series with you and then have those long convoluted conversations after. I want to rest my head on your lap and for you to play with my hair. I want to listen to our favourite songs and sing them horribly whilst you laugh at me and I reply by sticking my tongue out. I want to look into your eyes and just sigh with content. I want you to kiss me gently - on the lips, neck, cheek. I want you to hold me close. I want to feel safe in your arms. I want to never let go. I want us to be together. I want us to laze around and eat pizza. I want to watch scary movies with you just so I have an excuse to hold your hand and cuddle. I want to confide in you when I feel down. I want you to wipe my tears away and tell me that everything will be okay. I want to show you how special you are to me. I want all of those and I want a whole lot more.</p>
		
			<p>Honestly Vladi, I know that I can be totally bonkers sometimes and I say things that are so unrealistic and a little far-fetched, but just know that I DO want you. You have touched my heart in a way that no one else has before and all I want in this moment is for you to take all of the things that I have said and I want you to just hold them close. Because the thing is, I DO mean them; every single word. And I DO want to fall hopelessly in love with you because i DO honestly believe that you are so worth it, even if you don't believe it... Everyone deserves love, so why can't I fall in love with you? It makes sense, doesn't it? I mean, to put matters simply, you are the greatest person I have ever met and I feel absolutely privileged to be so close to you.  You have allowed me to get to know you and I appreciate every second, every word, every memory and just everything. These feelings I have are so intense and so frightening all at the same time, but I would never change them, even if it was for the world. So my darling, I guess I do in fact have three words to sum up everything that I feel and everything that I'm trying to say...</p>
		
			<p><b>I love you.</b></p>
		
			<p>And I honestly think that I will continue to love you for the rest of my life. I really want us to end up together because you just make me so happy. You're perfect. I want to know what the future holds for us, because truth be told I want you in mine.</P>
		
			<i>Forever and always,</i>

			<p>P.S. I wrote this letter ages ago, but I forgot the date. Winky face.</p>
